# üè¶ Loan Status Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a loan application will be **approved** or **rejected** based on historical applicant data using various supervised machine learning algorithms.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

Loan officers at financial institutions must decide whether to approve a loan application based on multiple factors. This manual process can be subjective, time-consuming, and prone to errors. The goal of this project is to **build a machine learning model that automates loan status prediction**, increasing speed and accuracy.
